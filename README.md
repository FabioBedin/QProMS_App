## QProMS - Quantitative PROteomics Made Simple

QProMS is a shiny app you can access [here](https://bioserver.ieo.it/shiny/app/qproms). The app enables easy but powerful and reproducible analyses for label-free proteomics data. It works out of the box with  major data-dependent and data-independent search engine results (MaxQuant, FragPipe, Spectronaut, DIA-NN, AlphaPeptide) as well as custom result tables. It can produce publication-quality figures and export HTML reports and parameter files for sharing and reproducing results.

### Getting started

The app guides you through a typical analysis workflow for proteomics:

1. Data upload and experimental design annotation
2. Quality control and handling missing values
3. Statistical analysis (clustering, volcano and more)
4. Network and functional analysis
5. Exporting results.

#### The upload page

Upload search engine results. Files should have a column for gene IDs, and columns for quantitation of each protein in the respective conditions. Several search engines are supported by default.
